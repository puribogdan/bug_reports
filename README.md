**Description:**

The search functionality consistently returns an internal error when attempting to search for products using various keywords.

**Steps to Reproduce:**


1. Navigate to the OpenCart demo website: https://demo.opencart.com/
2. In the website's search bar, enter any keyword (e.g., "shoes").
3. Click the magnifying glass search button.


**Expected Behavior:**

The search results should display a list of relevant products matching the entered keyword(s).

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead of displaying search results, an error message is shown: 
"Internal Server Error!
There has been a problem loading the page you are looking for. We are working hard to resolve the issue and the page should return shortly.
If the problem persists please use the contact us form for help."

**Additional Information:**

This issue occurs consistently and is not dependent on the chosen keyword(s).

The error persists even after refreshing the page or attempting the search at different times.

**Priority:** P1

**Severity:** Critical
