**Title:**
**The search functionality consistently returns an internal error**

**Description:**

The search functionality consistently returns an internal error when attempting to search for products using various keywords.

**Steps to Reproduce:**


1. Navigate to the OpenCart demo website: https://demo.opencart.com/
2. In the website's search bar, enter any keyword (e.g., "shoes").
3. Click the magnifying glass search button.


**Expected Behavior:**

The search results should display a list of relevant products matching the entered keyword(s).

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead of displaying search results, an error message is shown: 
"Internal Server Error!
There has been a problem loading the page you are looking for. We are working hard to resolve the issue and the page should return shortly.
If the problem persists please use the contact us form for help."

**Additional Information:**

This issue occurs consistently and is not dependent on the chosen keyword(s).

The error persists even after refreshing the page or attempting the search at different times.

**Priority:** P1

**Severity:** Critical

**Title: Add to Cart Button Issue**

**Description:**

When attempting to add an item to the cart from a product page, clicking the "Add to Cart" button does not result in the item being added to the cart. 

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to the OpenCart demo website: https://demo.opencart.com/
2. On the website's homepage, on the bottom left side, click on the product with the name “Macbook”
3. On the product page click the "Add to Cart" button.
 

**Expected Behavior:**

Upon clicking the "Add to Cart" button, the selected item should be added to the shopping cart, and the cart icon or count should update to reflect the addition.

A message pops up saying “Success: You have added MacBook to your shopping cart!” but
the "Add to Cart" button does not add the item to the cart. The cart icon or count remains unchanged.

**Additional Information:**
